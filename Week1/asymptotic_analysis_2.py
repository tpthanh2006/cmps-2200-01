* Upper Bound (Big-O, O(f(n))):
Describes the worst-case growth rate of an algorithm. It means the algorithm will never take more than O(f(n)) time for large inputs. It’s a guarantee that the running time won’t exceed a certain function.

* Lower Bound (Omega, Ω(f(n))):
Describes the best-case growth rate. It means the algorithm will always take at least Ω(f(n)) time for large inputs. It’s a guarantee that the running time won’t be less than a certain function.

* Tight Bound (Theta, Θ(f(n))):
Describes the exact asymptotic growth rate. It means the algorithm’s running time is both O(f(n)) and Ω(f(n)), so it grows at the same rate as f(n) for large inputs.

* Summary:

Upper bound: maximum time (worst case)
Lower bound: minimum time (best case)
Tight bound: exact time (both upper and lower match)
